<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Welcome to our Privacy Policy page. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.</p>

<h2>Database Development and Integration</h2>
<p>We have designed and integrated a relational database to manage information about farmers and their products. The database contains sample data to simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring robust and comprehensive demonstrations. All data is handled with care and is stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<h2>User Role Definition and Authentication System</h2>
<p>Our system supports two distinct user roles: Farmers and Employees. We have implemented secure login functionality with authentication mechanisms to protect user data and ensure role-specific access. Only authorized users can access certain data and functionalities based on their role.</p>

<h3>For Farmers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Farmers can add products to their profile and view their own product listings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Employees</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Employees can add new farmer profiles, view all products from specific farmers, and use filters for product searching.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Features for Farmers and Employees</h2>
<p>We have developed specific functionalities tailored to the needs of both Farmers and Employees to ensure a seamless user experience.</p>

<h3>For Farmers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Enable product addition feature where farmers can add new products with details like name, category, and production date.</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Employees</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Functionality to add new farmer profiles with essential details.</li>
    <li>Capability to view and filter a comprehensive list of products from any farmer based on criteria such as date range and product type.</li>
</ul>

<h2>User Interface Design and Usability</h2>
<p>Our user interface is designed to be user-friendly with intuitive navigation and a clear layout. The design is responsive, ensuring accessibility on various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones). We strive for clear and accurate data presentation, avoiding any ambiguity or errors.</p>

<h2>Data Accuracy and Validation</h2>
<p>We incorporate data validation checks to maintain the accuracy and consistency of the information entered into the system. Error-handling mechanisms are in place to prevent system crashes and data corruption.</p>

<h2>Development Process and Testing</h2>
<p>Our prototype is developed iteratively, with testing conducted on each functionality as it is implemented. User experience (UX) testing is conducted with sample users to gather feedback on the usability and effectiveness of the interface.</p>

<h2>Documentation and Readme File</h2>
<p>A comprehensive readme file is available, detailing step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment, guidelines on how to build and run the prototype, and explanations of the system’s functionalities and user roles. The readme file is written in clear, concise language, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.</p>

<h2>Submission Package</h2>
<p>Our submission package includes all source code, database scripts, and additional resources compiled into a zip file. The readme file is included within this package for easy access and guidance. The submission represents a complete, functional prototype that aligns with the project's objectives and requirements.</p>
